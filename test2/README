This directory will contain a unit test for DC latent fault for the 4 step flow.
The safety mechanism is a logic bist circuit

netlist1.sp - tests the circuit in mission mode
netlist2.sp - test mode for the logic bist

Step 1 - DCrf: run-tb1-xa
  run-tb1-xa/fs

Step 2 - SM undetected faults
  run-tb2-xa/fs

Step 2b - generate the dual fault list file
  gen_daul_fault.sh tb1.xa/tb1.xa tb2.xa/tb2.xa > step3.dual_fault_list


Step 3 - Run Dual Fault Injection
  run-tb3-xa/fs - this will use a config file that only contains FO and DO - can the dual point faults be identified?
  
Step 4 - Run 
  run-tb4-xa/fs - this will use a config file the also contains the LDO command proposal
